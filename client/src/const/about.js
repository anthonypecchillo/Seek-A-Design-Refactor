  'Ever since Lyandra was four years old, she knew she wanted to be a creator. She accomplished numerous art courses in high school, and graduated from New York Institute of Technology in Manhattan with a Bachelor\'s in Graphic Design. She understood and learned the field has many aspects beneath it such as advertising, packaging, editorial, and book design, but none caught her attention. What truly caught Lyandra\'s eye was the second half of the design operation; print and production. She finds it to be the most important piece of a finalized creation, because without print, a design will only be just a design.\n',
